# About DevOps Command Hub

Welcome to the **DevOps Command Hub** - your comprehensive guide to DevOps tools, commands, and best practices. This project was created to provide developers and system administrators with quick access to essential commands with modern, user-friendly features.

## Features

### ðŸ”„ One-Click Copy
Every command block includes a copy button that allows you to copy commands to your clipboard with a single click. No more manual selection and copying!

### ðŸ“š Expandable Sections  
Complex command sequences are hidden behind expandable sections to keep the interface clean while providing detailed information when needed.

### ðŸŒ™ Dark Mode Support
The site automatically adapts to your system's dark/light mode preferences, providing a comfortable viewing experience at any time of day.

### ðŸ“± Mobile Responsive
All command blocks and interfaces are optimized for mobile devices, so you can access commands on the go.

### ðŸš€ Fast Loading
Built with Jekyll and optimized for GitHub Pages, the site loads quickly and efficiently.
